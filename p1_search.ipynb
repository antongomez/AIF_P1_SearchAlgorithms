    "- `__init__(self, initial, goal)`: This method initializes the problem with the initial state and the goal state.\n",
    "- `is_valid_state(self, state)`: This method checks if a given state is valid, taking into account the number of rows and columns of the problem.\n",
    "- `actions(self, state)`: This method returns the possible actions that can be taken from a given state. The actions will consists on the next states that can be reached from the current state.\n",
    "- `result(self, state, action)`: This method returns the state that results from taking an action from a given state (in this case, the action is the next state).\n",
    "- `h(self, node)`: This method returns the heuristic value of a given node.\n"
